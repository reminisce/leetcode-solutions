/**
 * Created on 8/21/16.
 * We are playing the Guess Game.
 * The game is as follows:
 *
 * I pick a number from 1 to n.
 * You have to guess which number I picked.
 *
 * Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell
 * you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.
 *
 * However, when you guess a particular number
 * x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x.
 * You win the game when you guess the number I picked.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * n = 10, I pick 8.
 *
 * First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
 * Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
 * Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
 *
 * Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
 *
 * You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
 * Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how
 * much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
 *
 * Hint:
 *
 * The best strategy to play the game is to
 * minimize the maximum loss you could possibly
 * face. Another strategy is to minimize the
 * expected loss. Here, we are interested in
 * the first scenario.
 * Take a small example (n = 3). What do you end
 * up paying in the worst case?
 * Check out this article if you're still stuck.
 * The purely recursive implementation of minimax
 * would be worthless for even a small n. You
 * MUST use dynamic programming.
 * As a follow-up, how would you modify your
 * code to solve the problem of minimizing the
 * expected loss, instead of the worst-case loss?
